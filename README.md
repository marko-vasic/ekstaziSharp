# Ekstazi# - Class-level Regression Test Selection for .NET

## Running

Try Ekstazi#
example.sh script provides an usage example of Ekstazi#. The script
does following: 1) builds Ekstazi# project if it is not built. 2)
clones FluentValidation project from github which will be used as an
example project under test. 3) Runs tests on FluentValidation using
Ekstazi#. Note that the first time all tests will be run in
FluentValidation project. Afterwards, 0 tests should be run unless you
modify FluentValidation project.

More information about different settings for running Ekstazi# are
work in progress, please stay tuned, or feel free to contact the
authors.
